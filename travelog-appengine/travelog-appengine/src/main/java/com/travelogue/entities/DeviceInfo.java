/**
 * An entity for Android device information.
 * 
 * Its associated endpoint, DeviceInfoEndpoint.java, was directly generated from
 * this class - the Google Plugin for Eclipse allows you to generate endpoints
 * directly from entities!
 * 
 * DeviceInfoEndpoint.java will be used for registering devices with this App
 * Engine application. Registered devices will receive messages broadcast by
 * this application over Google Cloud Messaging (GCM). If you'd like to take a
 * look at the broadcasting code, check out MessageEndpoint.java.
 * 
 * For more information, see
 * http://developers.google.com/eclipse/docs/cloud_endpoints.
 * 
 * NOTE: This DeviceInfoEndpoint.java does not use any form of authorization or
 * authentication! If this app is deployed, anyone can access this endpoint! If
 * you'd like to add authentication, take a look at the documentation.
